#👋 Hi, I'm Linh!

I'm a Mechanical Engineering student at UT Austin with a passion for robotics, coding, and creative problem solving.I’m most excited when I get to bridge the gap between hardware and software—whether that’s through building systems, writing code, or prototyping new ideas.

💡 I’m driven by curiosity and collaboration, and I’m always looking for opportunities to grow, build, and work with others who share the same energy.
