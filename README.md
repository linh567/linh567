# üëã Hi, I'm Linh!

I'm a Mechanical Engineering student at UT Austin with a passion for robotics, coding, and creative problem-solving.  
I‚Äôm most excited when I get to bridge the gap between hardware and software‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs through building systems, writing code, or prototyping new ideas.

I'd love to connect and learn from others in the field! Feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/linhtran56/) or @linh.tran@utexas.edu
